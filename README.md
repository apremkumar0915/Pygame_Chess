Undergraduate project to create a fully functional Chess GUI that can be used by two players to play chess virtually. Implemented using pygame. Retains all functionality of chess including, castling, en-passant and pawn promotion. Later functionality was added to use a neural network trained on images of chess positions to load games from 400x400 images of computer chess boards.
